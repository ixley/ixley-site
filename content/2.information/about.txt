  <li><h2>I am an @job-title who loves problem-solving.</h2></li> 
  <li>I believe that great design comes not just from a thorough understanding of visual and interactive elements,</li> 
  <li>but that it depends on a solid understanding of contextual application as well.</li> 
  <li>And while I can get excited about everything from icons and breaking grids to user flows and design patterns,</li> 
  <li>I ultimately want to contribute to projects with valuable, real-world applications.</li>
