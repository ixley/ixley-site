Faced with the struggle of many aid-based non-profits to stand out among a sea of others, Asmi International needed a visual identity that would convey their unique approach within the existing disaster aid sector. With their mission of "Empowering Survivors Through Literacy and Self-Expression" Asmi wanted a symbol that represented the life, energy, and empowerment of the people it works with. Their excitement with the final logo made this project even more rewarding to work on.
