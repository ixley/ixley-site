  %h1.section-heading Full-Spectrum Designer
  %p
    I’m a full-spectrum product designer. I take a problem, work with product managers to identify how the product can <strong>adapt to solve the problem</strong>, <strong>iterate on concepts</strong>, mockups, and prototypes to <strong>resolve design questions</strong>, and coordinate with engineers to <strong>implement</strong>.

  %p
    In more specific terms, I sketch, wireframe, and prototype, and am comfortable working with front-end code (I <i class="fa fa-heart-o" style="font-size: .8em;"><span>heart</span></i> CSS). I enjoy focusing on
    %strong solving the problems at hand
    to focus on the user experience while helping to build up <strong>cohesive design systems</strong>.


  %h2.section-heading Solving Meaningful Problems
  %p
    Ultimately, I want to contribute to <strong>projects with valuable, real-world applications</strong>. Can we bring more nuance to the internet? Can we use tools to inspire more empathy? Can we tackle bigger problems than innovating on advertising platforms and coming up with new door-to-door delivery services? I think we can, and that's the kind of work I want to be doing.
