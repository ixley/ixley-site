    Legal agreements get a bad rap for a good reason. They dictate an increbibly important set of terms, but are painfully dense. We can do better. With the goal of greater transparency, I took a couple of WellnessFXâ€™s primary user agreements, and paired each section with a concise summary in plain, easy to understand English.
