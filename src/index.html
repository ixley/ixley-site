          <p>
            I worked with a small product team to build out and grow
            HelloWorks‚Äîa form-builder for simplifying business forms and
            agreements.

            I prioritized creative and lightweight design solutions, including
            marketing growth projects, that helped grow ARR from $200K to over
            $1.5M and improved ROAS by 10x within 2 years.

          <p>
            Starting as the sole product designer at HelloSign, I designed the
            HelloWorks form-builder and customer portal from the ground up,
            collaborating with a small product team to deliver a freemium model
            with 100+ new accounts, monthly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also created and iterated on a design system and component
            libraries for HelloSign and HelloWorks products, resulting in
            improved design consistency, accessibility standards, and improved
            designer/developer productivity.
