          %p Starting as the sole product designer at HelloSign, I designed the HelloWorks form-builder and customer portal from the ground up, collaborating with a small product team to deliver a freemium model with 100+ new accounts, monthly. 
          %p I also created and iterated on a design system and component libraries for HelloSign and HelloWorks products, resulting in improved design consistency, accessibility standards, and improved designer/developer productivity.
